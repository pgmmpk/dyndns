= DynDNS login script =

This is a website login example using "headless browser" phantomJS.

Use it like this:

phantomjs dyndns.js <username> <password>

== Rationale ==
Apart from getting my hands dirty with phantomJS, I'd like to have an automated way of login into my free dyndns account.

Why? Recently DynDNS introduced a new policy of requiring free users to log into web portal at least once a month (or have their 
DNS bindings revoked). This should help keeping those pesky naggers away.
